# Image-Enhancement-and-Colorization-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network


**Objective:** 
  Colorizing of noisy grayscale images using two approaches, first involving preprocessing then colorization and other involving colorization then enhancement.

**Technique:**
  We start by collecting a dataset of colorized images, we then convert these images to grayscale and apply various noise filters to them. We follow two approaches to ultimately colorize the image:
    1) In the first approach, the noisy image is taken and we try to denoise the image to get a suitable output. We will then apply colorization techniques to the output image.
    2) In the next approach, instead of denoising the image first, we will directly apply colorization techniques on the noisy image. Then denoising technique is applied.

**Conclusion:**
  Out of the two approaches we conclude that the second approach is better i.e., Colorizing the noisy Grayscale Image and then denoising the obtained colorized image produces a better result.
